Labadmin Script Server is a server repository to automate script execution on hosts on booting time. Its written in Bash shellscript. 

Scripts are stored in repsitories and each time hosts boots query if there are pending scripts to exec, and in that case download and exec them.

# Working schema
  * Script server works over SSH server, and use `labadmin-script_server` file to decide the list of script that need be executed by hosts.
  * When hosts boots:
    * Connect to server and exec `labadmin-script_server` to query the list of pending scripts.
  * Scripts are stored on server and when hosts boots query the list of pending scripts to execute.
  * Pending scripts to execute are selected by:
    * **Regular expresiÃ³n** according **hostname**: only host with hostname match regular expresion script are executed.
    * **Select script**: each script has a select function to personalize if script is executed (each time, only if no had a correct execution.
